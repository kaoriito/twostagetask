2. Click on **DOWNLOAD ALL** and you should see a pop-up appear that says "Preparing download". It may take some time to zip the files, depending on your internet connection speed.

3. After it is done zipping, you may see a pop-up window, depending on your browser. Click on YES, and your download will begin. This may also take some time.

__Installing the Application__
1. Now that the file has downloaded, double click on the TwoStageInstaller_mcr.zip file to first unzip the file, then double click on the resulting icon (TwoStageInstaller_mcr).  

2. When you see a pop-up that says "TwoStageInstaller_mcr cannot be opened becase the developer cannot be verified", click on "Cancel".

4. You should see this screen below. Where it says "TwoStageInstaller_mcr" was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer, click on "Open Anyway".
